# KobroCMS 1.1.0, revived in 2025

## Blast from the future

Hey reader, this is Pekkis from the future (2025).

When somebody at our work advertised some internal gamified security training, based in OWASP top 10, and utilizing a very badly written app, I just **had to** revive KobroCMS to be runnable. Nostalgy is strong in me!

Much of the material (all the deep documentation about the known security issues) has been lost to time. I'll try to find that stuff from somewhere, but I am not hopeful.

## Credits

Dr. Kobros Foundation broudly present: KobroCMS. The next option in discovery of enterprise management content.

Produced by Dr. Kobros Foundation.

## System requirement

You need (this be a testy application so we need like reference config, yes!)

- Docker & Docker Compose. Very easy set to up in 2025!

**_ You MUST never be running KobroCMS on a real production or important machine or leave KobroCMS open to world. It still have some small security problem inside! _**

## Install

Installing kobros easy:

```bash
docker compose up
```

After docker up, you surf to http://kobrocms.tunk.io:8666/

If stuff work, it good! If not, debug. If still not work, shed tears and call mom!
